# IdeaStruct

## Overview

MindGrasp utilizes knowledge graphs as a powerful tool for collecting, representing, and summarizing various forms of input data. The idea revolves around creating a structured graph where diverse data points are modeled as nodes, and the relationships between them are represented by edges. The central node acts as a summary point, collecting and aggregating the input data from the other nodes. MindGrasp simplifies the interpretation, analysis, and understanding of complex, interconnected information.

## Development Process

1. **Ideation**
   - Brainstormed ideas leveraging team members' skills
   - Decided to integrate ML with a full-stack web app
   - Chose to focus on knowledge graphs based on HackMIT challenges

2. **Planning & Research**
   - Explored resources on knowledge graphs and visualization
   - Discussed tech stack options (graph libraries, databases, frameworks)
   - Outlined basic project architecture

3. **Development**
   - Set up project structure and environment
   - Implemented core backend for knowledge graph management
   - Developed frontend interface with graph visualization
   - Integrated ML components for graph analysis

4. **Challenges**
   - Optimized graph rendering for large datasets
   - Ensured data consistency between frontend and backend
   - Implemented effective search within the knowledge graph

5. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Conducted basic unit and integration tests
   - Gathered quick user feedback on UI/UX
   - Made iterative improvements based on testing

6. **Documentation**
   - Created brief API documentation and user guide
   - Prepared a concise presentation for demo

Throughout the process, we held regular check-ins to discuss progress and overcome obstacles, making the most of time constraints alotted by HackMIT.

## Technical Details
IdeaStruct is a Flask-based web application that leverages AI to generate and query a dynamic knowledge graph. It integrates OpenAI's GPT models for natural language processing, with a flexible backend supporting both Neo4j and in-memory graph databases. The application features a modular architecture with a custom integration manager for extensibility. On the frontend, it uses Cytoscape.js for interactive graph visualization. Key functionalities include AI-driven entity and relationship extraction, conditional data addition to prevent duplicates, and URL scraping for automated data ingestion.
